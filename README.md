Hello, This is were my coding projects would be, Its just a repository with me experimenting with python stuff and learning

If you want to participate and helping me learning programming (With python or C++) you can create a branch and add your examples with explanation comments in your code !

I'm learning another programming language so maybe the project would be here too, idk.
Have fun exploring my projects :)
